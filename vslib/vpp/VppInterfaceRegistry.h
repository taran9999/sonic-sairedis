     * Single owner of interface identity for the VPP SAI backend.
     *
     * Every field that is also a lookup key lives in one place, and every
     * mutation updates all affected indexes in the same step. That invariant is
     * the entire reason this class exists: the same facts used to be spread over
     * several side maps (m_lag_bond_map, m_swif_to_bdid, m_swif_to_port_id, and
     * the tap/name maps) whose lifetimes were only loosely related to each other,
     * so a teardown that missed one left the others answering with stale data.
     *
     * What deliberately stays outside: the SAI object hashes. The registry
     * knows names and oids, not attributes.
     *
     * The osif->hwif mapping parsed from sonic_vpp_ifmap.ini lives here too,
     * even though it is a seed read from a file rather than derived state,
     * because it is the only remaining way to answer "what is the VPP name of
     * this netdev" and splitting name resolution across two owners is what
     * this class exists to stop.
     *
     * Threading: this class is internally synchronized by a recursive mutex and
     * is safe to call from the command thread, the FDB aging thread and the VPP
     * event thread. It is a LEAF lock -- no other lock is ever acquired while it
     * is held -- so it cannot take part in a deadlock cycle. This mirrors the
     * vpp_intf_table_mutex leaf lock in SaiVppXlate.c, which guards the shared
     * interface tables read from both the command and the event paths.
     *
     * The lock is recursive because the public API self-nests: remove() recurses
     * through collectChildren(), every setter re-enters findByHwif(), and
     * resolveHwIfByOsIf() calls loadIfMapping().
     *
     * IMPORTANT: only the registry's own state is synchronized. A VppInterface
     * returned by findBy*() is NOT individually locked, and the shared_ptr is a
     * lifetime guarantee, NOT a lock -- the mutex is already released by the
     * time the pointer reaches the caller. The record therefore cannot be freed
     * underneath you, but its mutable fields (oid, tap name, sw_if_index) may be
     * rewritten by the command thread while you read them. A caller that does
     * not already hold m_apimutex must therefore read records through the
     * value-returning resolve*() accessors, which do the whole read inside the
     * lock, never by dereferencing a findBy*() result.
     *
     * The VPP API RX thread (staticMacEventCb) must still NEVER touch it: that
     * thread runs holding VPP_LOCK, and taking any further lock there would
     * break the "never acquire another lock while holding vpp_mutex" ordering
     * rule. It only enqueues onto m_mac_event_queue.
     *
     * This class makes no VPP API calls. Resolving a sw_if_index from VPP stays
     * in SwitchVpp, which then calls bindSwIfIndex(); that keeps the registry
     * free of SaiVppXlate.h and unit-testable on its own.
